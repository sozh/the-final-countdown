# FINAL PROJECT IDEAS - HALL
Note: I need to settle on one idea. Still winnowing down. Hope our talk can help with that. 

##### IDEA #1 - CAMPAIGN FINANCE: moderate vs progressive Ds
In California politics, many races come down to two Democrats. For example Sanchez v Harris for U.S. Senate, or Kim vs Wiener for state Senate. I have written stories are two such races.

I played with tableau, using the candidates' campaign finance forms. By manually tagging each entry (PAC, individual, etc), it becomes possible to see patterns showing generally who is supporting which candidate.

My viz would be simple, but effective: square tree maps, broken up by donation type. The size of the tree maps would be relative to overall amount of money. I wrote a long story about a CA senate race, but charts like these would truly be worth 1,000 words.

pros: relevant, publish-able, timely
cons: need to finish before election. not groundbreaking. other sites may already be doing this

questions to address: without knowing names or districts or details, could we ID so-called moderate and progressive Democrats with effective charts?

chart type: square area / tree maps

##### IDEA #2: TRAFFIC TIDES
Aside from accidents and construction, traffic on freeways tends to follow patterns. For example, people commute FROM the suburbs to the city in the morning, and the reverse in the evening. Or perhaps a sporting event regularly jams up a certain freeway.

As far as I know, services like Google Maps and Waze tend to focus on CURRENT traffic conditions. What I would like to create, is a RESOURCE of overall patterns. Over time, locals figure out these patterns and learn to adapt to them. But for occasional drivers, these patterns are an enigma.

With the premise that traffic is as predictable as the tides, I would make a visualization that would allow people to plan ahead, and avoid bad traffic situations IN ADVANCE.

pros: solving a real-world problem. potential to be useful
cons: not exactly journalism (?), not sure if DATA is available

questions to address: is traffic predictable, like tides? 

chart types: traditional choice would be map with red/orange/green overlays, but could there be a better presentation?


##### IDEA #3: NEWSPAPER NAMES
TRONC. 
The institution formerly known as the Tribune Media Company is now known as Tronc. I thought of a doing a piece on historical newspaper names. Specifically, what names were more common for newspapers, and what did those names signify? I played with this, scraping some info from Wikipedia. The visualization would highlight especially common names such as TIMES, HERALD, TRIBUNE, ARGUS, GUARDIAN and explain the historical origin of these names. 

pros: Tronc is a ridiculous name. researching journalism history
cons: Tronc is now old news. This doesn't exactly scream for a visualization over a text story.

questions to answer: what names were most common in the last couple hundred years of newspapers? What principles underly those names?

chart type: tree map? bar chart with personification of name?

##### IDEA #4: DOLORES PARK CITATIONS
Dolores Park in San Francisco's Mission District is a textbook COMMONS: a shared community space. Many different types of people frequent the park and there are many rules, which are unevenly enforced. 

The heart of my investigation would be littering. Littering seems to be the most pervasive problem at the park. I was wondering: while police will randomly bust people for drinking or smoking weed (arguably victimless crimes), do they ever bust people for littering (arguably a crimes that harms us all). 

I FOIA'd some documents from the SF Parks Dept to look into this question. In the time period I requested, I found NO citations for littering. 

This visualization could look at citations at Dolores Park over a longer time period, and show what police are writing tickets for. 

pros: community journalism. holding power accountable. 
cons: if they DON'T ticket for littering, then what is the VIZ? 

questions to address: what do the Dolores Park cops ticket and arrest people for? How does that compare to park users' conceptions of the most urgent problems in the park? 

type of chart: depends on the data.
